# BellServ
BellServ is a personal homeserver implementation of the [Matrix](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.15/server-server-api/) protocol.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3

Client im gonna use for testing: https://fluffychat.im/web/

implement matrix protocol endpoints -> other providers can interface with you via the functionality you provide in those endpoints

what if I make it so when you have an account on my backend, it exposes a secret "breakroom" chatroom that only my users can see
